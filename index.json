Circulating RNA molecules are known to have a role in cancer; however, their involvement before diagnosis remains an open question. In this study, we investigated circulating RNA dynamics in prediagnostic LC samples, focusing on smokers, to identify if and when diseaserelated signals can be detected in serum. We sequenced small RNAs in 542 serum LC samples donated up to 10 years before diagnosis and 519 matched cancer-free controls coming from 905 individuals in the Janus Serum Bank. This sample size provided sufficient statistical power to independently analyze time to diagnosis, stage, and histology. The results showed dynamic changes in differentially expressed circulating RNAs specific to LC histology and stage. The greatest number of differentially expressed RNAs was identified around 7 years before diagnosis for earlystage LC and 1–4 years prior to diagnosis for locally advanced and advanced-stage LC, regardless of LC histology. Furthermore, NSCLC and SCLC histologies have distinct prediagnostic signals. The majority of differentially expressed RNAs were associated with cancer-related pathways. The dynamic RNA signals pinpointed different phases of tumor development over time. Stage-specific RNA profiles may be associated with tumor aggressiveness. Our results improve the molecular understanding of carcinogenesis. They indicate substantial opportunity for screening and improved treatment and will guide further research on early detection of LC. However, the dynamic nature of the RNA signals also suggests challenges for prediagnostic biomarker discovery.","tags":["serum","rna","ncRNA","traits","age","sex","smoking"],"title":"A 10 year prediagnostic followup study shows that serum RNA signals are highly dynamic in lung carcinogenesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sonja Lagström","Sinan Uğur Umu","Maija Lepistö","Pekka Ellonen","Roger Meisal","Irene Kraus Christiansen","Ole Herman Ambur","Trine B.

To uncover these genomic events in an HPV infection, we have developed an innovative and cost-effective sequencing approach named TaME-seq (tagmentation-assisted multiplex PCR enrichment sequencing). TaME-seq combines tagmentation and multiplex PCR enrichment for simultaneous analysis of HPV variation and chromosomal integration, and it can also be adapted to other viruses. For method validation, cell lines (n = 4), plasmids (n = 3), and HPV16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 positive clinical samples (n = 21) were analysed. Our results showed deep HPV genome-wide sequencing coverage. Chromosomal integration breakpoints and large deletions were identified in HPV positive cell lines and in one clinical sample. HPV genomic variability was observed in all samples allowing identification of low frequency variants. In contrast to other approaches, TaME-seq proved to be highly efficient in HPV target enrichment, leading to reduced sequencing costs. Comprehensive studies on HPV intra-host variability generated during a persistent infection will improve our understanding of viral carcinogenesis. Efficient identification of both HPV variability and integration sites will be important for the study of HPV evolution and adaptability and may be an important tool for use in cervical cancer diagnostics.","tags":["hpv","NGS"],"title":"TaME-seq: An efficient sequencing approach for characterisation of HPV genomic variability and chromosomal integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trine B.

Understanding how common traits influence ncRNA expression is essential for assessing their biomarker potential. In this study, we identify associations between sncRNA expression and common traits (sex, age, self-reported smoking, body mass, self-reported physical activity). We used RNAseq data from 526 serum samples from the Janus Serum Bank and traits from health examination surveys. Ageing showed the strongest association with sncRNA expression, both in terms of statistical significance and number of RNAs, regardless of RNA class. piRNAs were abundant in the serum samples and they were associated to sex. Interestingly, smoking cessation generally restored RNA expression to non-smoking levels, although for some sncRNAs smoking-related expression levels persisted. Pathway analysis suggests that smoking-related sncRNAs target the cholinergic synapses and may therefore potentially play a role in smoking addiction. Our results show that common traits influence circulating sncRNA expression. It is clear that sncRNA biomarker analyses should be adjusted for age and sex. In addition, for specific sncRNAs, analyses should also be adjusted for body mass, smoking, physical activity and technical factors.","tags":["serum","rna","ncRNA","traits","age","sex","smoking"],"title":"Circulating small non-coding RNAs associated with age, sex, smoking, body mass and physical activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543705200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543705200,"objectID":"50a79062b441bd88fa936f0450412962","permalink":"/project/serum-rna-biomarkers/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/serum-rna-biomarkers/","section":"project","summary":"We want to find early prediction biomarkers of cancer.","tags":["serum","rna","mirna","cancer"],"title":"Serum RNA bio-markers of Cancer","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543618800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543618800,"objectID":"1696b420601a14e1f7c7d6f82ef1c10d","permalink":"/project/rna-rna-avoidance/","publishdate":"2018-12-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/rna-rna-avoidance/","section":"project","summary":"This project includes RNA-RNA interaction prediction benchmark and Avoidance project.","tags":["rna-rna","binding","interaction","ncRNA","avoidance"],"title":"RNA-RNA interactions and Avoidance","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tobias Fehlmann","Christina Backes","Julia Alles","Ulrike Fischer","Martin Hart","Fabian Kern","Hilde Langseth","Trine Rounge","Sinan Ugur Umu","Mustafa Kahraman","Thomas Laufer","Jan Haas","Cord Staehler","Nicole Ludwig","Matthias Hübenthal","Benjamin Meder","Andre Franke","Hans-Peter Lenhof","Eckart Meese","Andreas Keller"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1513810800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513810800,"objectID":"4a6edbe046475bba0fa78dd975f3bf83","permalink":"/publication/sncrna-map/","publishdate":"2017-12-21T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sncrna-map/","section":"publication","summary":"Although the amount of small non-coding RNA-sequencing data is continuously increasing, it is still unclear to which extent small RNAs are represented in the human genome.

We also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage.

While genomics is now a mature field, our capacity to identify noncoding RNA elements in bacterial and archaeal genomes is hampered by the difficulty of de novo identification. The emergence of new technologies for characterizing transcriptome outputs, notably RNA-seq, are improving noncoding RNA identification and expression quantification. However, a major challenge is to robustly distinguish functional outputs from transcriptional noise. To establish whether annotation of existing transcriptome data has effectively captured all functional outputs, we analysed over 400 publicly available RNA-seq datasets spanning 37 different Archaea and Bacteria. Using comparative tools, we identify close to a thousand highly-expressed candidate noncoding RNAs. However, our analyses reveal that capacity to identify noncoding RNA outputs is strongly dependent on phylogenetic sampling. Surprisingly, and in stark contrast to protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic window for effective use of comparative methods is perversely narrow: aggregating public datasets only produced one phylogenetic cluster where these tools could be used to robustly separate unannotated noncoding RNAs from a null hypothesis of transcriptional noise. Our results show that for the full potential of transcriptomics data to be realized, a change in experimental design is paramount: effective transcriptomics requires phylogeny-aware sampling.","tags":["serum","rna","ncRNA"],"title":"Robust Identification of Noncoding RNA from Transcriptomes Requires Phylogenetically-Informed Sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Oğul","Sinan U Umu","Y Yener Tuncel","Mahinur S Akkaya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1316124000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1316124000,"objectID":"9870a3489d54acf314a000004e59c3e9","permalink":"/publication/mirna-binding/","publishdate":"2011-09-16T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mirna-binding/","section":"publication","summary":"Elucidation of microRNA activity is a crucial step in understanding gene regulation. One key problem in this effort is how to model the pairwise interactions of microRNAs with their targets. As this interaction is strongly mediated by their sequences, it is desired to set-up a probabilistic model to explain the binding preferences between a microRNA sequence and the sequence of a putative target. To this end, we introduce a new model of microRNA-target binding, which transforms an aligned duplex to a new sequence and defines the likelihood of this sequence using a Variable Length Markov Chain. It offers a complementary representation of microRNA–mRNA pairs for microRNA target prediction tools or other probabilistic frameworks of integrative gene regulation analysis. The performance of present model is evaluated by its ability to predict microRNA–target mRNA interaction given a mature microRNA sequence and a putative mRNA binding site. In regard to classification accuracy, it outperforms two recent methods based on thermodynamic stability and sequence complementarity. The experiments can also unveil the effects of base pairing types and non-seed region in duplex formation.","tags":["rna","mirna","binding"],"title":"A probabilistic approach to microRNA-target binding","type":"publication"}]
