To uncover these genomic events in an HPV infection, we have developed an innovative and cost-effective sequencing approach named TaME-seq (tagmentation-assisted multiplex PCR enrichment sequencing). TaME-seq combines tagmentation and multiplex PCR enrichment for simultaneous analysis of HPV variation and chromosomal integration, and it can also be adapted to other viruses. For method validation, cell lines (n = 4), plasmids (n = 3), and HPV16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 positive clinical samples (n = 21) were analysed. Our results showed deep HPV genome-wide sequencing coverage. Chromosomal integration breakpoints and large deletions were identified in HPV positive cell lines and in one clinical sample. HPV genomic variability was observed in all samples allowing identification of low frequency variants. In contrast to other approaches, TaME-seq proved to be highly efficient in HPV target enrichment, leading to reduced sequencing costs. Comprehensive studies on HPV intra-host variability generated during a persistent infection will improve our understanding of viral carcinogenesis. Efficient identification of both HPV variability and integration sites will be important for the study of HPV evolution and adaptability and may be an important tool for use in cervical cancer diagnostics.","tags":["hpv","NGS"],"title":"TaME-seq: An efficient sequencing approach for characterisation of HPV genomic variability and chromosomal integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trine B.

Understanding how common traits influence ncRNA expression is essential for assessing their biomarker potential. In this study, we identify associations between sncRNA expression and common traits (sex, age, self-reported smoking, body mass, self-reported physical activity). We used RNAseq data from 526 serum samples from the Janus Serum Bank and traits from health examination surveys. Ageing showed the strongest association with sncRNA expression, both in terms of statistical significance and number of RNAs, regardless of RNA class. piRNAs were abundant in the serum samples and they were associated to sex. Interestingly, smoking cessation generally restored RNA expression to non-smoking levels, although for some sncRNAs smoking-related expression levels persisted. Pathway analysis suggests that smoking-related sncRNAs target the cholinergic synapses and may therefore potentially play a role in smoking addiction. Our results show that common traits influence circulating sncRNA expression. It is clear that sncRNA biomarker analyses should be adjusted for age and sex. In addition, for specific sncRNAs, analyses should also be adjusted for body mass, smoking, physical activity and technical factors.","tags":["serum","rna","ncRNA","traits","age","sex","smoking"],"title":"Circulating small non-coding RNAs associated with age, sex, smoking, body mass and physical activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543705200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543874350,"objectID":"50a79062b441bd88fa936f0450412962","permalink":"https://sinanugur.github.io/project/serum-rna-biomarkers/","publishdate":"2018-12-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/serum-rna-biomarkers/","section":"project","summary":"We want to find early prediction biomarkers of cancer.","tags":["serum","rna","mirna","cancer"],"title":"Serum RNA bio-markers of Cancer","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543618800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543874350,"objectID":"1696b420601a14e1f7c7d6f82ef1c10d","permalink":"https://sinanugur.github.io/project/rna-rna-avoidance/","publishdate":"2018-12-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/rna-rna-avoidance/","section":"project","summary":"This project includes RNA-RNA interaction prediction benchmark and Avoidance project.","tags":["rna-rna","binding","interaction","ncRNA","avoidance"],"title":"RNA-RNA interactions and Avoidance","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543427654,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://sinanugur.github.io/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Tobias Fehlmann","Christina Backes","Julia Alles","Ulrike Fischer","Martin Hart","Fabian Kern","Hilde Langseth","Trine Rounge","Sinan Ugur Umu","Mustafa Kahraman","Thomas Laufer","Jan Haas","Cord Staehler","Nicole Ludwig","Matthias Hübenthal","Benjamin Meder","Andre Franke","Hans-Peter Lenhof","Eckart Meese","Andreas Keller"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1513810800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543769823,"objectID":"4a6edbe046475bba0fa78dd975f3bf83","permalink":"https://sinanugur.github.io/publication/sncrna-map/","publishdate":"2017-12-21T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sncrna-map/","section":"publication","summary":"Although the amount of small non-coding RNA-sequencing data is continuously increasing, it is still unclear to which extent small RNAs are represented in the human genome.

On the basis of these regions, we found that among the known small non-coding RNA classes, microRNAs were the most prevalent. In subsequent steps, we characterized variations of miRNAs and performed a staged validation of 11 877 candidate miRNAs. Of these, many were actually expressed and significantly dysregulated in lung cancer. Selected candidates were finally validated by northern blots. Although isolated miRNAs could still be present in the human genome, our presented set likely contains the largest fraction of human miRNAs.","tags":["serum","rna","ncRNA"],"title":"A high-resolution map of the human small non-coding transcriptome","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Umu SU","Langseth H","Bucher-Johannessen C","Fromm B","Keller A","Meese E","Lauritzen M","Leithaug M","Lyle R","Rounge T"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512687600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543769823,"objectID":"c2de7b086944842d5684f7f3c641f860","permalink":"https://sinanugur.github.io/publication/rna-serum/","publishdate":"2017-12-08T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rna-serum/","section":"publication","summary":"Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules have fundamental roles in cells and many are also stable in body fluids as extracellular RNAs.

We also investigated biological and technical variation in expression, and the results suggest that many RNA molecules identified in serum contain signs of biological variation.

Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.","tags":[],"title":"Avoidance of stochastic RNA interactions can be harnessed to control protein expression levels in bacteria and archaea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stinus Lindgreen","Sinan Uğur Umu","Alicia Sook-Wei Lai","Hisham Eldai","Wenting Liu","Stephanie McGimpsey","Nicole E.

While genomics is now a mature field, our capacity to identify noncoding RNA elements in bacterial and archaeal genomes is hampered by the difficulty of de novo identification. The emergence of new technologies for characterizing transcriptome outputs, notably RNA-seq, are improving noncoding RNA identification and expression quantification. However, a major challenge is to robustly distinguish functional outputs from transcriptional noise. To establish whether annotation of existing transcriptome data has effectively captured all functional outputs, we analysed over 400 publicly available RNA-seq datasets spanning 37 different Archaea and Bacteria. Using comparative tools, we identify close to a thousand highly-expressed candidate noncoding RNAs. However, our analyses reveal that capacity to identify noncoding RNA outputs is strongly dependent on phylogenetic sampling. Surprisingly, and in stark contrast to protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic window for effective use of comparative methods is perversely narrow: aggregating public datasets only produced one phylogenetic cluster where these tools could be used to robustly separate unannotated noncoding RNAs from a null hypothesis of transcriptional noise. Our results show that for the full potential of transcriptomics data to be realized, a change in experimental design is paramount: effective transcriptomics requires phylogeny-aware sampling.","tags":["serum","rna","ncRNA"],"title":"Robust Identification of Noncoding RNA from Transcriptomes Requires Phylogenetically-Informed Sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hasan Oğul","Sinan U Umu","Y Yener Tuncel","Mahinur S Akkaya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1316124000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544186130,"objectID":"9870a3489d54acf314a000004e59c3e9","permalink":"https://sinanugur.github.io/publication/mirna-binding/","publishdate":"2011-09-16T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mirna-binding/","section":"publication","summary":"Elucidation of microRNA activity is a crucial step in understanding gene regulation. One key problem in this effort is how to model the pairwise interactions of microRNAs with their targets. As this interaction is strongly mediated by their sequences, it is desired to set-up a probabilistic model to explain the binding preferences between a microRNA sequence and the sequence of a putative target. To this end, we introduce a new model of microRNA-target binding, which transforms an aligned duplex to a new sequence and defines the likelihood of this sequence using a Variable Length Markov Chain. It offers a complementary representation of microRNA–mRNA pairs for microRNA target prediction tools or other probabilistic frameworks of integrative gene regulation analysis. The performance of present model is evaluated by its ability to predict microRNA–target mRNA interaction given a mature microRNA sequence and a putative mRNA binding site. In regard to classification accuracy, it outperforms two recent methods based on thermodynamic stability and sequence complementarity. The experiments can also unveil the effects of base pairing types and non-seed region in duplex formation.","tags":["rna","mirna","binding"],"title":"A probabilistic approach to microRNA-target binding","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
